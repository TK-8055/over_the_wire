Level 0:
   Just login through the terminal with ssh with user name bandit0 and password bandit0 at "@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" 
   CMD:
       "sshpass -f 0 ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"
       sshpass --> Can supply the password automaticaly
       -f --> It is used for reading the password file 
       ssh (or) Secure shell --> It is a network protocal that provides a secure and encrypeted way to remotely access
       -p --> It refers to port number 2220
       bandit0 --> User name 
       @bandit.labs.overthewire.org --> It is address of the domain

       "ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" and password can entered manullay

       Step 1:
              Just read the readme file "cat readme"

Level 1:
   Login with username bandit1 and the password we have got before using the terminal
   Our problem is to read a file named "-".
   CMD:
      "sshpass -f 1 ssh -p 2220 bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"
      
      Step 1:
             The file name is like - if we use "cat -" it just echo what ever we type it just print.
      Step 2:
             So we use "cat ./-" to read the file

Level 2:
   Login with username bandit2 and password we got on level 1
   Our problem is to read a file name with spaces and it starts with "-"
   CMD:
       "sshpass -f 2 ssh -p 2220 bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"

       Step 1:
              We can't normally read file name with space and it also start with "-"
       Step 2:
              We are going to use "cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--"

       Step 3:
              To read to the file space we use "\" at end of the word and starting of the space 
       Step 4:
              It will print the password just save it as 3

              "ls" to view the folder.
       Step 2:
              "cd filename" to enter into the file.
       Step 3:
              If use ls we can will not find any thing because the file start with "." which means it is hidden to view it use "ls -a".
       Step 4:
               Use cat cmd to read the file make sure how many "." are there and letter case.
       Step 5:
              It will print the password just save it as 4
