Level 1:
   Login with username bandit1 and the password we have got before using the terminal and our problem is to read a file named "-".
   CMD:
      "sshpass -f 1 ssh -p 2220 bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"
      
      Step 1:
             The file name is like - if we use "cat -" it just echo what ever we type it just print.
      Step 2:
             So we use "cat ./-" to read the file
      step 3:
             It will print the password just save it as 2
      Step 4:
             Exit form the terminal

Level 2:
   Login with username bandit2 and password we got on level 1 our problem is to read a file name with spaces and it starts with "-"
   CMD:
       "sshpass -f 2 ssh -p 2220 bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"

       Step 1:
              We can't normally read file name with space and it also start with "-"
       Step 2:
              We are going to use "cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--"

       Step 3:
              To read to the file space we use "\" at end of the word and starting of the space 
       Step 4:
              It will print the password just save it as 3
       Step 5:
              Exit form the terminal
