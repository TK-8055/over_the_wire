Level 0:
   Just login through the terminal with ssh with user name bandit0 and password bandit0 at "@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" 
   CMD:
       "sshpass -f 0 ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"
       sshpass --> Can supply the password automaticaly
       -f --> It is used for reading the password file 
       ssh (or) Secure shell --> It is a network protocal that provides a secure and encrypeted way to remotely access
       -p --> It refers to port number 2220
       bandit0 --> User name 
       @bandit.labs.overthewire.org --> It is address of the domain

       "ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org" and password can entered manullay

       Step 1:
              Just read the readme file "cat readme"
       Step 2:
              Save the password as 1
       Step 3:
              Exit from terminal

Level 1:
   Login with username bandit1 and the password we have got before using the terminal
   Our problem is to read a file named "-".
   CMD:
      "sshpass -f 1 ssh -p 2220 bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"
      
      Step 1:
             The file name is like - if we use "cat -" it just echo what ever we type it just print.
      Step 2:
             So we use "cat ./-" to read the file
      step 3:
             It will print the password just save it as 2
      Step 4:
             Exit form the terminal

<<=======================================xxxxx===============================================>>

Level 2:
   Login with username bandit2 and password we got on level 1
   Our problem is to read a file name with spaces and it starts with "-"
   CMD:
       "sshpass -f 2 ssh -p 2220 bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"

       Step 1:
              We can't normally read file name with space and it also start with "-"
       Step 2:
              We are going to use "cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--"

       Step 3:
              To read to the file space we use "\" at end of the word and starting of the space 
       Step 4:
              It will print the password just save it as 3
       Step 5:
              Exit form the terminal

<<=======================================xxxxx===============================================>>

Level 3:
       Login with username bandit3 and password we got on level 2
       We need to find a hidden file in a folder called "inhere"
  CMD:
       "sshpass -f 3 ssh -p 2220 bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"


       Step 1:
              "ls" to view the folder.
       Step 2:
              "cd filename" to enter into the file.
       Step 3:
              If use ls we can will not find any thing because the file start with "." which means it is hidden to view it use "ls -a".
       Step 4:
               Use cat cmd to read the file make sure how many "." are there and letter case.
       Step 5:
              It will print the password just save it as 4
       Step 6:
              Exit form the terminal

Level 4:
       Login with username bandit4 and password we got on level 3
       We need to find the file which as the password from multiple file 
  CMD:
       "sshpass -f 4 ssh -p 2220 bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"

       Step 1:
              Go into the file that at staring.
       Step 2:
              Use the cmd ls to find the file.

              There are nine file and we can check one by one.
       Step 4:
              Are we can use cmd like find,grep and exec.
       Step 5:
             CMD==> "find -type f -exec file {} + | grep "text"".
             
             find -> It is used to find file (or) folder
             -type f -> Used to specifies that we are looking for a file 
             -exec file {} + -> Executes the file.
             | grep "text" -> Filter the text file alone (or) ASCII text

Level 5:
       Login with username bandit5 and password we got on level 4
       We need find the folder and file which as password
        1) Human-readable
        2) 1033 bytes in size
        3) not executable

 CMD:
       "sshpass -f 5 ssh -p 2220 bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org"

       Step 1:

              There are 19 folder and we can check one by one.
       Step 4:
              Are we can use cmd like find,size.
       Step 5:
             CMD ==> "find -type f -size 1033c".
       Step 6:
             use cat cmd to print the file "cat ./maybehere07/.file2".
        step 7 
              it will print the password just save it as 6
       step 8:

            We need to find a file that is both owned by user bandit7 and group bandit6
       Step:2
            We use "find /-type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null"
